## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive, low-friction booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency with a clear design system  
- Ensure fast loading times and perceived performance  
- Prioritize mobile-first responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG)  

### Key Features
- Powerful property search with filters (location, dates, price, guests, amenities)  
- Rich property details (gallery, amenities, reviews, map, availability)  
- Simple, secure checkout (guest details, payment, confirmation)  
- User authentication and saved preferences (optional)  

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Discover properties in a responsive grid/list with key info (price/night, rating, location). Includes filters, sort (price/rating), and pagination or infinite scroll. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Deep dive into a single property: image gallery, description, amenities, rules, reviews, map, price breakdown, and date/guest selector with live availability and a prominent ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù CTA. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Minimal, step-light form: trip summary, guest details, payment method, price total with fees/taxes, clear policies, and a final confirmation. Inline validation and error messaging for trust. |

### Why a User‚ÄëFriendly Booking UX Matters
A user-friendly booking experience reduces drop-off, builds trust, and increases conversions. Clear navigation, predictable patterns, accessible components, and fast feedback help users complete tasks confidently‚Äîespecially on mobile and during payment where friction is most costly.
