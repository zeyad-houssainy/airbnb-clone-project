## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive, low-friction booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency with a clear design system  
- Ensure fast loading times and perceived performance  
- Prioritize mobile-first responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG)  

### Key Features
- Powerful property search with filters (location, dates, price, guests, amenities)  
- Rich property details (gallery, amenities, reviews, map, availability)  
- Simple, secure checkout (guest details, payment, confirmation)  
- User authentication and saved preferences (optional)  

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Discover properties in a responsive grid/list with key info (price/night, rating, location). Includes filters, sort (price/rating), and pagination or infinite scroll. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Deep dive into a single property: image gallery, description, amenities, rules, reviews, map, price breakdown, and date/guest selector with live availability and a prominent ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù CTA. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Minimal, step-light form: trip summary, guest details, payment method, price total with fees/taxes, clear policies, and a final confirmation. Inline validation and error messaging for trust. |

### Why a User‚ÄëFriendly Booking UX Matters
A user-friendly booking experience reduces drop-off, builds trust, and increases conversions. Clear navigation, predictable patterns, accessible components, and fast feedback help users complete tasks confidently‚Äîespecially on mobile and during payment where friction is most costly.

### Design Properties

#### Color Styles
- Primary: #FF5A5F  
- Secondary: #008489  
- Background: #FFFFFF  
- Text: #222222  
- Secondary Text: #717171

#### Typography
- Primary body:  
	- Font family: Circular  
	- Font weight: 500 (Medium)  
	- Font size: 16px
- Headings:  
	- Font family: Circular  
	- Font weight: 700 (Bold)  
	- Font size: 24px‚Äì32px
- Secondary text:  
	- Font family: Circular  
	- Font weight: 400 (Book)  
	- Font size: 14px

### Why Identify Design Properties Early
Documenting colors, typography, spacing, and component tokens up front creates a single source of truth. It speeds up development, improves visual consistency, reduces rework, and makes handoff between design and engineering smoother‚Äîespecially when scaling a design system across multiple pages and contributors.
